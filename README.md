# NLP_Geospatial

## Introduction

Geospatial research often involves complex methods for analyzing and visualizing geographic data. This project introduces an innovative approach by integrating voice commands with text input for geo-thematic exploration. Using technologies like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Transformers, and OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim API for live mapping, users can interact with geographic data through natural language. This system enables users to ask location-based queries, analyze geographic information, and visualize maps effortlessly, making geospatial analysis more accessible and user-friendly.

## Project Description

### Overview  
This project introduces a voice-enabled system for geospatial exploration, allowing users to interact with maps and spatial data using natural language. Traditional geographic data tools can be complex, but by integrating voice commands, we make it easier to find locations, analyze data, and visualize maps seamlessly.  

Our system leverages technologies like **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP) with BERT**, and **OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim API** for real-time geocoding and mapping. This enables users to ask location-based questions and receive accurate map visualizations without manual input.

### Key Components  

#### 1️⃣ Speech-to-Text Conversion  
We use **Google’s Speech-to-Text API** to convert spoken queries into text. This eliminates the need for manual typing and makes interacting with maps more intuitive. The API is highly accurate and supports multiple languages, ensuring accessibility for diverse users.  

#### 2️⃣ Keyword Recognition  
To process user queries, we use **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, a powerful AI model that understands language context. We fine-tune BERT to identify geographic terms from user input, making sure the system accurately detects locations and map-related commands.  

#### 3️⃣ Geocoding with Nominatim API  
Once a user asks for a location, we use the **Nominatim API** (from OpenStreetMap) to convert the place name into precise latitude and longitude coordinates. This geocoding step helps pinpoint exact locations, ensuring the system understands and maps user requests correctly.  

#### 4️⃣ Mapping with OpenStreetMap (OSM)  
After obtaining the coordinates, we display the location on **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**, a rich and detailed mapping platform. OSM provides real-time geographic data, including roads, buildings, and landmarks, allowing users to explore locations effortlessly.  

### Why This Matters  
This project simplifies geospatial exploration by making maps interactive and accessible through voice commands. Instead of manually searching for places or analyzing geographic data through complex tools, users can simply **speak their queries and see instant results**. This is particularly useful for:  
- Researchers analyzing geographic trends  
- Urban planners visualizing locations  
- General users looking for an easier way to navigate maps  

With this approach, we make geospatial analysis **more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly**.
