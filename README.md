# Introduction

Geospatial research often involves complex methods for analyzing and visualizing geographic data. This project introduces an innovative approach by integrating voice commands with text input for geo-thematic exploration. Using technologies like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Transformers, and OpenStreetMapâ€™s Nominatim API for live mapping, users can interact with geographic data through natural language. This system enables users to ask location-based queries, analyze geographic information, and visualize maps effortlessly, making geospatial analysis more accessible and user-friendly.
